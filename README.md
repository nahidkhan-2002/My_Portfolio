Want a custom badge set (GitHub stars, last commit, deploy status)? I can help you generate that too.

Let me know:
- Did you use **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion**, or any UI library?
- Do you want a more casual tone (for personal brand) or fully professional (for recruiter/HR)?

I'll fine-tune it based on that.
